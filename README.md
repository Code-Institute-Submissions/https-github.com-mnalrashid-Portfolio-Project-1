# Welcome to Sligo
This is a static interactive three-page website. It responds fully to users' actions and provides information about County Sligo. The purpose of this website is to encourage people to visit Sligo. I tried to provide essential information about Sligo's most famous places to visit and activities to do.

## UX:
The website is designed and fully responsive on desktop, tablet and mobile devices.

## Navigation:
On the journey to the website, the user will find seamless navigation between pages and key points. 

### First page:
- On the first page, it welcomes the user, in the background of the top, a short video will play which is introduced about Sligo.

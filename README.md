# Welcome to Sligo
This is a static interactive 3-pages website. It responds fully to users' actions and provides information about County Sligo. The purpose of this website is to encourage people to visit Sligo. I tried to provide essential information about Sligo's most famous places to visit and activities to do.

The website is designed and fully responsive on desktop, tablet and mobile devices.
